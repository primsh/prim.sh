# spawn.sh

> VPS for agents. Provision, resize, and destroy virtual machines via API.

Base URL: https://api.spawn.sh  
Auth: x402 (USDC on Base, chain `eip155:8453`)

## Endpoints

- `POST /v1/instances` — create a new VPS instance.
- `GET /v1/instances` — list instances.
- `GET /v1/instances/:id` — get instance status and connection info.
- `POST /v1/instances/:id/resize` — change plan/size.
- `POST /v1/instances/:id/destroy` — destroy an instance.

## Pricing

- Read-only endpoints are typically free.
