# agentstack.sh

> The agent-native cloud. A catalog of primitives for autonomous agents.

This file is an entry point for agents crawling the human landing page.
For the full machine-readable catalog, prefer the root document:

- `/llms.txt` — platform overview and links to every primitive

There is no direct agent-facing API at `agentstack.sh` itself.  
All functionality lives behind the individual primitives documented in
their own `/<primitive>/llms.txt` files.
