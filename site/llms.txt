# Prim

> The agent-native stack. Infrastructure primitives for autonomous agents.
> No signup. No GUI. No KYC. Pay with USDC, get resources.

Prim provides independent infrastructure primitives. Each accepts x402
payment (USDC on Base) as authentication. An agent with a funded wallet
can consume any primitive without human intervention.

**Status: Private beta on Base Sepolia testnet.**

## Requesting access

This service is in private beta. If you get a 403 `wallet_not_allowed`
response, you need to request access first.

```
POST https://api.prim.sh/api/access/request
Content-Type: application/json

{ "wallet": "0xYourWalletAddress", "reason": "optional reason" }
```

Response: `201 { "id": "abc123", "status": "pending" }`

Your request will be reviewed. Once approved, your wallet is added to
the allowlist and you can use all paid primitives.

## How x402 payment works

1. Call any endpoint. If payment is required, you get HTTP 402 with a
   `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header containing payment requirements (price, network, payTo).
2. Sign an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` for the required amount.
3. Retry the same request with a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header containing the signed payment.
4. The facilitator settles the payment on-chain. You get your response.

Use `@x402/fetch` (TypeScript) or any x402-compatible client to handle this automatically.

Chain: Base Sepolia (`eip155:84532`) during beta. Token: USDC.

## Getting started

Install the CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL prim.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Then use it:

```bash
prim wallet create        # Generate and register a wallet
prim faucet usdc          # Get 10 test USDC (free)
prim store create-bucket  # Create a storage bucket (pays via x402)
```

Run `prim <command> --help` for options. The CLI handles wallet
management, x402 payment signing, and all primitive interactions.

If `prim` is not installed, use the HTTP API directly:

1. Generate a wallet (any EVM private key).
2. Register it: `POST https://wallet.prim.sh/v1/wallets` (free, EIP-191 signature).
3. Get test USDC: `POST https://faucet.prim.sh/v1/faucet/usdc` (free, rate-limited).
4. Use any primitive — x402 payment happens automatically.

## Live primitives

These are deployed and responding to requests now.

- [wallet.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/wallet/llms.txt) — wallet registration (free)
- [store.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/store/llms.txt) — object storage (S3-compatible buckets and objects)
- [spawn.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/spawn/llms.txt) — VPS provisioning (DigitalOcean)
- [faucet.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/faucet/llms.txt) — testnet USDC and ETH faucet (free)
- [search.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/search/llms.txt) — web search, news, URL extraction

## Built (not yet deployed)

These primitives are implemented but not yet live on the network.

- [email.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/email/llms.txt) — email mailboxes, send/receive, webhooks
- [mem.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/mem/llms.txt) — vector memory and KV cache
- [domain.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/domain/llms.txt) — domains and DNS records
- [token.prim.sh](https://prim.sh/token/llms.txt) — ERC-20 token deployment and Uniswap pools

## Planned

vault, cron, pipe, code, ring, browse, infer, docs, watch, trace,
auth, id, pins, mart, ship, hands, pay, corp, hive, ads
