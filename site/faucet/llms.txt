## Quick Start

  1. POST /v1/faucet/usdc with {"address": "0x..."} → receive 10 test USDC (free)
  2. POST /v1/faucet/eth with {"address": "0x..."} → receive 0.01 test ETH (free)
  3. GET /v1/faucet/status?address=0x... → check cooldown before dripping

## Tips

  - No x402 payment required — faucet is entirely free.
  - Check GET /v1/faucet/status before dripping to avoid wasted 429 responses.
  - ETH cooldown is 1 hour; USDC cooldown is 2 hours per address.
  - USDC uses Circle Faucet API with treasury wallet ERC-20 transfer as fallback.
  - faucet.sh only operates on Base Sepolia — mainnet addresses return 403.
