\* Two costs per API call: **(1)** the listed price, paid in USDC to Primitive Shell, and **(2)** Base chain gas (~$0.001–0.005 in ETH), paid to network validators — not to us. Operations priced at $0.001 ("x402 floor") are the minimum the protocol needs to identify the caller's wallet. This revenue covers protocol overhead (caller identification, ownership scoping, abuse prevention) — it is not a provider pass-through cost.

Prices reflect current provider rates and may change. See [Terms of Service](https://prim.sh/terms) for details.
