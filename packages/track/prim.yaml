  # Track a package by tracking number
  $ curl -X POST https://track.prim.sh/v1/track \
      -H "X-402-Payment: $TOKEN" \
      -d '{"tracking_number": "1Z999AA10123456784", "carrier": "ups"}'

  }

quick_start:
  - "POST /v1/track with {tracking_number, carrier} → get package status, ETA, events ($0.05)"

tips:
  - "Pass carrier slug (e.g. 'ups', 'fedex', 'usps', 'dhl') for accurate routing."
  - "Omit carrier if unknown — the service will attempt auto-detection."
  - "Poll periodically until status is 'delivered' for delivery confirmation workflows."
  - "events array contains full tracking history ordered newest-first."

limits:
  - "1000+ carriers supported via TrackingMore API"
  - "Rate limit applies per wallet"

ownership: "Stateless. No package data is stored per wallet. Each request is an independent lookup."
