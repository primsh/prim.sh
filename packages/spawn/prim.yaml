  # Deploy a VPS in one HTTP request

  }

quick_start:
  - "POST /v1/ssh-keys with name + public_key → register SSH key"
  - "POST /v1/servers with name, type, image, location → create server ($0.01)"
  - "Poll GET /v1/servers/:id until status is \"running\" → get IP address"
  - "DELETE /v1/servers/:id when done → release resources and get deposit refund"

tips:
  - "Server returns immediately with status 'initializing' — poll until 'running' for the IP."
  - "Register SSH keys first via POST /v1/ssh-keys to enable passwordless SSH access."
  - "Unused deposit is refunded on DELETE. Budget for the expected runtime."
  - "Only 'small' type (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) is available during beta."
  - "user_data field accepts cloud-init scripts to automate first-boot setup."
  - "Server must be stopped before resize. stop → resize → start."

limits:
  - "Max concurrent servers per wallet: 3"
  - "Available types: small (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) only during beta"
  - "Locations: nyc3, sfo3, ams3, lon1, fra1, sgp1, tor1, blr1, syd1 (DigitalOcean)"
  - "Images: ubuntu-24.04, ubuntu-22.04, debian-12, fedora-41"

ownership: "All servers and SSH keys are scoped to the wallet address extracted from the x402 payment."

      - "The internet has a status code for payments. It's been reserved since 1997. **HTTP 402: Payment Required.**"
      - "Every other cloud provider requires: an email, a password, a credit card, KYC verification, an API key, a dashboard, a billing page, a support ticket system. **Agents don't have emails.**"
      - "x402 is the missing piece. Agent sends request → server returns 402 with payment details → agent pays (USDC on Base) → server returns the resource. **The payment IS the authentication.**"
      - "No account. No API key. No session. No cookies. Every request is self-contained. The payment receipt proves you paid, identifies your resources, and authorizes access. **Stateless compute for stateless agents.**"
