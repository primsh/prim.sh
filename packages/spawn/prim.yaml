    title: "Why"
    highlight: "x402"
    paragraphs:
      - "The internet has a status code for payments. It's been reserved since 1997. **HTTP 402: Payment Required.**"
      - "Every other cloud provider requires: an email, a password, a credit card, KYC verification, an API key, a dashboard, a billing page, a support ticket system. **Agents don't have emails.**"
      - "x402 is the missing piece. Agent sends request → server returns 402 with payment details → agent pays (Lightning/L2/Stripe) → server returns the resource. **The payment IS the authentication.**"
      - "No account. No API key. No session. No cookies. Every request is self-contained. The payment receipt proves you paid, identifies your resources, and authorizes access. **Stateless compute for stateless agents.**"
