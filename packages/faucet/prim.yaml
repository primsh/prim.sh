hero_example: |
  # Get 10 test USDC (2hr cooldown)
  $ curl -X POST https://faucet.prim.sh/v1/faucet/usdc \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"address": "0xYourWalletAddress"}'

  { "txHash": "0xabc...", "amount": "10000000", "token": "USDC" }

  # Get 0.01 test ETH (1hr cooldown)
  $ curl -X POST https://faucet.prim.sh/v1/faucet/eth \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"address": "0xYourWalletAddress"}'

quick_start:
  - "POST /v1/faucet/usdc with {\"address\": \"0x...\"} → receive 10 test USDC (free)"
  - "POST /v1/faucet/eth with {\"address\": \"0x...\"} → receive 0.01 test ETH (free)"
  - "GET /v1/faucet/status?address=0x... → check cooldown before dripping"
  - "GET /v1/faucet/treasury → check treasury ETH balance"
  - "POST /v1/faucet/refill → batch-claim ETH from CDP faucet into treasury"

tips:
  - "No x402 payment required — faucet is entirely free."
  - "Check GET /v1/faucet/status before dripping to avoid wasted 429 responses."
  - "ETH cooldown is 1 hour; USDC cooldown is 2 hours per address."
  - "USDC uses Circle Faucet API with treasury wallet ERC-20 transfer as fallback."
  - "faucet.sh only operates on Base Sepolia — mainnet addresses return 403."

limits:
  - "USDC: 10 USDC per drip, 2-hour cooldown per address"
  - "ETH: 0.01 ETH per drip, 1-hour cooldown per address"
  - "Network: Base Sepolia (eip155:84532) only"

ownership: "Rate-limited by wallet address. No wallet registration required — anyone can drip to any address."
